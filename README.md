# Gettingandcleaningdata
This is the repo for the 'Getting and cleaning data' module of the Data Science module on Coursera from Johns Hopkins

run_analysis.R (saved in this repo) performs the following tasks
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final output is shown in the finaltidy.txt file
